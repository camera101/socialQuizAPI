## Install Composer

If you have not installed Composer, do that now. I prefer to install Composer globally in `/usr/local/bin`, but you may also install Composer locally in your current working directory. For this tutorial, I assume you have installed Composer locally.

## Install the Application

After you install Composer, run this command from the directory of the application.

    php composer.phar install
